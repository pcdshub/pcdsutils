v0.5.0 (2021-07-22)
===================

Features
--------

-  Add central exception logging utilities that had previously been
   duplicated in both hutch-python and lucid.

Bugfixes
--------

-  Fix issues with the version difference display


v0.4.3 (2021-07-09)

Set the default log protocol to TCP, rather than UDP, so it works on
hutch machines. Large UDP packets do not make it from hutch consoles to
the log hosts.

===================

-  Add missing username field to logger messages
-  Fix dependency issues


v0.4.1 (2021-01-19)

No functional changes to the code.

===================

--------

-  Add release notes utility that converts from Github releases to
   ``release_notes.rst`` for documentation.
-  Transplant bash script interfaces from ``pcdsdaq`` as a more central
   place to keep them. These currently include :any:`get_hutch_name`,
   :any:`get_run_number` and :any:`get_ami_proxy`


v0.3.1 (2020-09-17)
===================

-  Do not propagate central logger records to root. Central logger
   should only be shipping out to logstash, regardless of the root
   logging configuration.


v0.3.0 (2020-06-08)
===================

-  Improvements to ``requirements-compare``:

   -  Add ``--ignore-docs`` to which makes differences at the
      docs-requirements not a critical error
   -  Set exit code to 1 in case requirements are not matching


v0.2.0 (2020-05-15)
===================

-  Add requirements file-related utilities (comparison of
   ``requirements.txt`` and conda ``meta.yaml``)

   -  Adds console utilities ``requirements-from-conda``
   -  Adds console utility ``requirements-compare``

-  Relies on ``qtpynodeeditor`` for inheriting superclass properties


v0.1.1 (2020-03-13)
===================

Fixes win32 ``os.uname`` issue


v0.1.0 (2020-03-13)
